Accounting method: (kontant or fakturerings)

1. How to check which method does the company have?
2. Which one is easiest?

  

To which account should the tickets go to? (1930-Företagskonto 2018-privatKonto)

if you have a separate account it should be företags, it does not matter if it is ‘officially’ a företags account in what regards the bank. Separate account = företags account
 

Les faktures ja les tenim al financial year

Fees

——

  

software fees go to ‘Mjukvara’

Put a rellevant title to be able to search it afterward

medicines and treatments are personal expenses (no bookkeep!)

—-

el laser de les cames es personal expenses (no bookkeep!)

—

newspapers have a category itself she did it manually: 

Title ‘tidningar’

 konto 1930 for kredit

 konto 6970 for debit

  

same amount on both

—

category for invoices coming from musicians/graphic designers… -> ‘inköp tjänsters inom EU’

  

—

(personal goods) costumes/cosmetics/incienso… expenses go to ‘inköp varor …’

  

‘inköp varor inom EU 25% MOMS’ if it is utomlads but inside EU for example

—

printing services: to print logos on t-shirts —>  ‘trycksaker’ category

—

Accounting expenses (redovisning expenses) are Louise’s expenses.

Bookio does not count as that, it counts as software expenses.

—-

‘medlems avgifter’ category for danscentrum

  

lookout for the service fee, you need to add it too

  

—

hotels goes to ‘hotel and logi’ category ‘kost och logi’ ?

——

 ‘friskvår’ category for massages and stuff like that

—-

parking tickets (not fines) go to ‘Parkerring’ (be careful about the country, inom EU , utom EU…)

—

  

fika goes to ‘representation’  choose it its utomlands or not

fikas abroad can’t claim VAT so don’t care about that when you upload them. ( you still need to upload them for it to count as expenses in the total company balance)

  

breakfast counts as fika!

  

Louise always looks at the tickets and adds the antal persons depending on what is in. If there are 4 coffees she adds 4 persons. I guess to match 

  

—

// temples/museums go to Mässor och utställiningar’

  

mention if the ticket was bought in Sweden/ country in the EU or outside the EU

  

——

just food (lunch, dinner and supermarket stuff)

search for [utlands traktamente](https://www.skatteverket.se/privat/skatter/arbeteochinkomst/traktamente/utlandstraktamente.4.2b543913a42158acf800016035.html) in google and go to the skatteverket site there you’ll see all the traktamente amounts in lots of countries. Find the country you want and you’ll see the max amount without taxes.

  

Keep in mind:

Sometimes it is easier to bookkeep just one withdrawal (with all the expenses added together) rather than bookkeep all tickets one by one. It counts like the company paid and … ? (didn’t get gat part)

  

we kan bookeep fikas

  

—-

skin creams go to the  ‘goods’ category

——

  

travel tickets go to ‘biljetter utrikes’ or ‘biljetter intrikes’

checkout if you are travelling between 2 cuntries! makes a difference ‘intrikes’ or ‘utrikes’

train, busses flights as well

  

  

travel related things like pictures to be able to get the traveling documents are also included in this category

—

  

pay attention to the tickets! 

remmeber the cosmetics we bought in falkland . the ticket said books! they didn’t even sell books! 

in that case just put books as the category.
