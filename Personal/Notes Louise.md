# To which account should the tickets be booked ? 

if you have a separate account it should be företags, it does not matter if it is ‘officially’ a företags account in what regards the bank.
Separate account = företags account

- 1930-Företagskonto  (payed from the company bank account) 
- 2018-privatKonto (payed from the private bank account)

# Extra vat return due to losses
You have 10k in tax refund in general. But you had with the last two years of your company a total of 230k in loss.
The first 5 years you can deduct the loss as a tax cut of 30 % if you want to if you had income otherwise. 
Since you had income from a employer I tried the company-loss tax cut and deducted 100k of that 230k. 
Then you will receive a tac refund of 38k instead of 10k.
Is that something you want to do? So you will still have 130k of a loss in your company that gets pushed forward to next year. 
And if you have a profit then you can use that loss against the profit and pay less taxes.
