## Main Takeaways of the article

**Implementing patterns right away leads to maintenance burden**
Do not implement design patterns beforehand!
They are build to solve common known problems.
Implementing beforehand leads to fixing problems you don't have.

Have a good understanding of what you are building (Behaviour,constrains...)
Design the simplest solution.
Introduce a pattern only where pain is repeated and measurable.

## Was there something I didn't agree with?
Nope!

## What question would I ask the author if I could?
Nothing really

## What am I now interested in because of this article
In learning design patterns to improve the projects I've done.
I never think about design patterns when I develop. So the first step is done.
Now the second step is to identify the pains and apply them to cure :)
