Something veery confusing. But lets brake it down
# LLM
[[Large Language model]]

## What is a *model* ?
When you apply an  [[algorithm]]  to a dataset, it produces a bunch of results.
From those results, model is able to predict the best output given an input.

So a model is the result of applying an [[algorithm]]  to a dataset. And from that, it can predict results.

## What is a *Language model* ?

It's a model that predicts sequences in natural language. The output can also be natural language ([natural language generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation)) but not necessarily. It can be other things (music, images...)

## What is a *Large Language model* ?

It's a language model trained with a massive amount of data. Capable of predicting a huge amount of different outputs from the same amount of inputs.

LLMs work as giant statistical prediction machines that repeatedly predict the next word in a sequence. They learn patterns in their text and generate language that follows those patterns.

# Different LLMs
- claude opus 4.6 (less exact but better at creating and brain storming )
- GTP 5.2 codex
- GTP 5.3 codex (very good at JS)
# Ways of interaction
- Web browser ([chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com/), [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com/) )
- Through a Code editor  
	- Native ([zed](https://zed.dev/), open code, claude code...)
	- Regular code editor + extension  (vscode + copilot)
- Terminal
	- Regular CLI (https://opencode.ai/, https://pi.dev/,https://charm.land/)
	- TUI (terminal UI)
- Desktop app
	- Native app terminal with a chat. (https://opencode.ai/)



# Agents
Agents are the AI built in the tool you use to interact with the model. They establish the best workflow to solve the input you've given.

The workflow can be stablished by the user manually. That is not an agent.
The workflow can be stablished automatically by an AI. That is an agent.
