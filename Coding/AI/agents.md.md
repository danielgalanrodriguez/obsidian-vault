# General AGENTS.md file to refine the responses when prompting

## Generating md files
- Use only Markdown syntax.
- Do not include html.
- Using HTML elements can create conflicts with the browser's UI and don't display correctly
- Optimise if needed for Obsidian note taking App.
- Include funny but relevant icons. I like to put some colour in the notes.
