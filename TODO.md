Here, I am following the same principles as always. They are part of my personal values. I continue receiving and applying feedback. I still try to utilise new work methods, and ways of programming.

  

For example, with all the work in finance-invoice-lib. From the begging we used the latest React libraries. Being able to develop with the latest tools (or at least up to date tools) felt as a big catch of fresh air. I didn't even notice it but working for relatively long periods of time only in F3 like getting back to for data fetching (tant stack query), styling (Tailwind), typing (TS). It has been super useful to listen and participate in different conversations about the problems that have been appearing. In some cases I took good notes on the problem solving methods they have applied.

​

And also Øredev! 😃 Still assimilating and rewatching videos to consolidate new methods and skills.
