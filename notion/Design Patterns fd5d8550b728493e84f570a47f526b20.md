# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They are like blueprints that can be customized to solve a particular design problem in your code. Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

There are several types of design patterns, categorized mainly into three groups:

1. **Creational Patterns**: These deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. Examples include Singleton, Factory, and Builder patterns.
2. **Structural Patterns**: These deal with object composition, ensuring that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn’t need to change as well. Examples include Adapter, Composite, and Decorator patterns.
3. **Behavioral Patterns**: These deal with object interaction and responsibility. They help in defining how objects interact and communicate with each other. Examples include Observer, Strategy, and Command patterns.

Using design patterns helps to improve code readability and reusability, making it easier to manage and modify your software.
