# Extra information

[DOM](Module%201%20React%20Fundamentals%2007eac004bfac44f8b6f041e172ee71a3.md):

The live-running environment that displays the website. 

The DOM is the living, breathing structure that makes up a live website / web application. When we visit a website, the browser turns the static HTML into the DOM.

To use an analogy: HTML is the blueprint for a specific car, and the DOM is the car itself, zipping around the city.

Here's another way to look at it:

- When you right-click and **“View source”**, you view the HTML, a static document that describes what will be constructed.
- When you right-click and **“Inspect element”**, to open the *Elements* pane, you're interacting with the DOM. You can change attributes and watch the UI update in response.

When we use a tool like React, it works by interacting with the DOM via JavaScript. It'll create, update, and delete DOM elements as required.

In case you're curious, DOM stands for Document Object Model.
