# 1. Basics (**Grunder**)

## 1.1 Bookkeeping (**Bokföring)**

Keeping records of business transactions and thereby reporting one's finances
events. 

This happens when, for ex.,  an invoice is registered with an amount on the account that describes the cost.

## 1.2 Accounting  (R**edovisning**)

Accounting is more than bookkeeping. Means not only recording transactions, but also compiling all business events and presenting it in a way that gives the recipient a picture of the company's results and position.

### External Accounting (**Extern redovisning)**

Is addressed to recipients *outside* the company. 

For ex. to stakeholders so they can decide whether they e.g. want to invest money in the company or if they want to sell goods to the company.

### Internal Accounting: (**Intern redovisning**)

Is addressed to recipients *inside* the company. 

The transactions that are recorded can also form the basis for the information needs of *internal* stakeholders, primarily management, for control and planning of operations. 

### Accounting system: (**Redovisningssystem**)

An accounting system supports the company in recording all the business
events that take place.

The systems that are used on the market today handle to a large extent both the internal and the external requirements on information. 

Which accounting system should be used is governed by which information is requested. What is crucial is that the benefit of the system exceeds the costs of setting it up and using it.

## 1.3 Taxation (**Beskattning)**

Annually, a company is taxed for the result it has done.

In the accounting there is often costs such as representation to clients who are not considered costs for tax purposes. Therefore can the tax result is higher than the accounting result. 

The tax is usually not handled on an ongoing basis during the year but in connection with the end of the year and the declaration with the Tax Agency.

## 1.4 **Different requirements for different companies**

The requirements to publish financial information differs depending on the type of company you work for.

Mainly joint-stock companies and economic associations, are obliged to ensure that their annual reports are available to all stakeholders.

Smaller individual traders do not have to submit an annual report, but they *must always draw up* annual accounts that they themselves shall archive.

All companies must always submit a tax return that takes its starting point in the accounting.

# **2. Results and balance sheet (Resultat och balansräkning)**

The income statement and balance sheet are the two reports that mainly show the financial health of the companies after each completed financial year.

## **2.1 Income Statement (Resultaträkningen)**

A profit and loss statement is a compilation of profit and loss accounts in the bookkeeping.

An income statement is always limited to a period of time.  A month, a quarter or a year.

### **Revenue (Intäkter)**

Is the total amount of income. 

The most common income is the sale of goods and services, but also sales of the company's assets and income interest belong here.

### **Costs (Kostnader)**

**A**re the value of resources consumed.

Examples of costs are rent, electricity, materials, salary, advertising, telephone, postage, insurance… .

### **The result (Resultatet)**

For the financial year is calculated by revenues minus costs. 

If the revenue is greater than the costs, the company makes a profit. 

If it were the other way around, the company makes a loss.

## 2.2 **Balance sheet (Balansräkningen)**

The balance sheet is a statement that shows a company's financial position at a certain point in time. 

This means that the balance sheet shows a "snapshot" or a static picture at a point in time.

### **Assets (Tillgångar)**

Are things that the company has legally at its disposal.

Examples of assets are bank balances, accounts receivable, inventory, fixtures, machinery, buildings and land. 

Assets are reported with apositive sign on the left side of the balance sheet.

### **Equity and liabilities (Eget kapital & skulder) (Patrimonio y pasivos)**

The money the owners have invested in the company is called equity.

It consists partly of start-up capital but also of capital additions that have been put in afterwards, as well as profits that have not been distributed to the owners.

It must balance the assets and thus show who has financed the company's assets.

An increase in a debt means either that assets increase or that equity reduces.
Likewise, an increase in an asset means that a debt increases or equity increases.

## 2.3 The connection

The income statement (Resultaträkningen) and the balance sheet (Balansräkningen**)** are linked to each other.

The result in the income statement is part of the Equity **in** the balance sheet. This means that both income and expenses affect the financial position in the balance sheet.

# 3. Bookkeeping (**Bokföring)**

## **3.1 Double entry**

Double-entry bookkeeping is a method for reporting the company's transactions in a systematic way. 

Double entry means that each transaction is recorded at least in two different accounts and on opposite sides of the accounts.

The sum of all debits (notes on the left side on accounts) require an equal amount of credits (notations on the right side of accounts) on at least one other account for each transaction.

The difference between debit and credit for each transaction should always be zero, which does the method to some extent self-controlling.

Posting an event in two places means that each listing must be made on two accounts and on the opposite pages on the accounts.
If the company pays a supplier debt with money from the cash register, this means that notations about this must be made both on the account for supplier debts and on the cash
account. 
If the company receives interest income on bank account, entries must be made both on the account for interest income and in the bank account.

## 3.2 **Business events and verifications (Affärshändelser och verifikationer)**

A business event can be described as events affecting the size, or the composition,
of the company's fortune.

Receipts and disbursements, incurred receivables and liabilities as well as own additions to and withdrawals from the activity is counted as business events.

All business events must be recorded continuously in one basic book and systematically in a main book.

Continuous bookkeeping means that all entries are made in chronological order, as they occur.
Systematic accounting means that business events of the same kind are noted in the same place, separate from business events of a different kind.

All business events must be able to be proved. Verifications are basic material for all listings and those consists of receipts, invoices, etc. 
Business events are often confirmed by invoices, but also an accounting order can serve as a verification. 
Roughly speaking, there are three types of verifications. 

First, verifications can be external documents, e.g. in terms of receipts, supplier invoices and
bank statements. 
Secondly, verifications can be internally produced,
e.g. when it comes to receipts, customer invoices and pay slips issued
by the company itself. 
Third, the company can print an accounting order that serves as verification. It may be done
when natural verifications are missing.

The verifications must be provided with a running verification number or other means of identification. 
A verification must contain information about when it was drawn up, when the business event occurred, what it refers to, what amount it applies to and which counterparty it concerns. This because the business event must be able to be assessed and valued by auditors, representatives of the Swedish Tax Agency, etc.

You may not subsequently go in and change booked business events. If you discover that something has been posted incorrectly, you are forced to create a correction entry and post in the accounting period in which the error is discovered. 
When one period is closed, you cannot go back and correct it the period. 

## **3.3 Key concepts**

**Deposits**, **withdrawals**, **income** and **expenses** must be recorded continuously. **Revenues** and **costs** must then be reported in the income statement. 
These six concepts are central to the understanding of, and the application of, accounting and accounting.

### **Deposits and** **withdrawals (Inbetalningar och utbetalningar)**

Both deposits and withdrawals occur at the time of payment, i.e. when the money changes hands. 
A deposit for one party results in a withdrawal for the other party.

### **Income and expenses (Inkomster och utgifter)**

Income is the financial compensation that a business receives from selling goods or services. Expenses are the financial compensation that a company is required to acquire resources. Income thus arises at the time of sale and expenses at the time of acquisition.

Business deals are often confirmed by invoices sent or received.

In some cases, it is appropriate to book expenses on asset accounts. This applies, among other things, to when it comes to machinery or inventory purchases.

### Revenues and costs

Revenue is the sale value of the services performed under a certain period.
Costs are the acquisition value of the resources consumed during the same period.
